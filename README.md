# Kaggle Titanic Competition

## Project Overview

This project is a machine learning model developed to predict passenger survival in the Titanic disaster. The dataset is part of Kaggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition, which challenges participants to build predictive models based on passenger attributes.

## Dataset Information

The dataset consists of two parts:

- `train_data.csv`: Used to train the model. It contains labeled data with known survival outcomes.
- `test_data.csv`: Used to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy. The survival outcomes are unknown and need to be predicted.

## Key Features and Approach

- Data preprocessing to handle missing values using statistical imputation (mean, mode, etc.).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key features influencing survival rates.
- Feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Machine learning model selection and training.
- Model evaluation and prediction.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`titanic-competion.ipynb`).
3. Execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and generate predictions.

## Next Steps

- Improve feature selection for higher accuracy.
- Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.
- Implement cross-validation techniques.
- Participate in Kaggle competitions with enhanced models.
