# Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains my work on the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition. Here's what it includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation techniques to prepare the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and insights on how different features relate to survival.
- **Model Selection**: Experimentation with various machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and potentially ensemble methods like XGBoost.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of which features most significantly impact the model's predictions.
- **Model Tuning**: Hyperparameter optimization to improve performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Final Submission**: The submission file for Kaggle leaderboard scoring.

### Key Files:
- `data_exploration.ipynb`: EDA and initial data insights.
- `feature_engineering.ipynb`: Techniques used to engineer features.
- `model_building.ipynb`: Implementation of machine learning models.
- `submission.csv`: The final submission file for the competition.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models and preprocessing
